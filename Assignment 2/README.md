# Assignment 2

JS Basics

## Questions
### Question 1
Write an arrow function named "findMode" that takes an array of numbers as input and returns the mode of the array. The mode is the number that appears most frequently in the array. If there are multiple modes, return any one of them.

### Question 2
Write an arrow function that takes an object as input and returns a new object where the keys and values are swapped.

For example, if the input is {“a”: 1, “b”: 2, “c”: 3}, then the output will be {1: "a", 2: "b", 3: "c"}.

### Question 3
Write a function called "multiply" that accepts two parameters: a callback function and two numbers. After multiplying the two numbers together, the callback function needs to be called.

### Question 4
Consider the following code snippet:

Fill in the empty spaces for Tasks 1 and 2 in the code by utilizing the relevant ES6+ features. Make sure Task 2 uses template literals and Task 1 uses the syntax for the arrow function. Here, a doubled value means if the number is 2, then the output will be 4.

Instructions:
- Replace the placeholders (`/* your arrow function here */` and `/* your forEachfunction here */`) with the correct code.
- For Task 1, use arrow function syntax with the map method to double each
- For Task 2, use template literals within the forEach method to log each doubled number along with its index.
